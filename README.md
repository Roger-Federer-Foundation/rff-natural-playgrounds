# Natural Playgrounds Toolkit

This is built with the Electric Book Jekyll template for creating books in multiple formats:

- print PDFs for high-end book publishing
- screen PDFs for reading on screen
- a website of books
- epubs for ebook distribution
- ebook apps for Android and iOS
- MS Word outputs for old-school editing.

This repo contains the content and generates PDF and website versions of the NPT. It also generates the HTML to be used in the app. The app is created in the [rff-npt-android-app](https://github.com/Roger-Federer-Foundation/rff-npt-android-app) repo.
